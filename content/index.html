                    <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>1/3 sour cream at room temperature</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup of whole milk at room temperature </li>
                    <li>3 Tablespoons of lemon juice</li>
                    <li>1 Tablesppon lemon zest</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Glaze</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1/2 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
                        <li>1 Tablespoon lemon juice</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Spray a 9 by 5 inch loaf pan with nonstick spray.</li>
                    <li>Whisk the flour, poppy seeds, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg and granulated sugar together until combined. Whisk in the oil, sour cream, milk, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, then whisk to completely combine. Avoid over-mixing; a few small lumps are OK.</li>
                    <li>Pour/spread the batter evenly into prepared loaf pan. Bake the bread for 50 minutes to 1 hour, covering loosely with foil about halfway through to help the loaf bake evenly. Poke the center of the bread with a toothpick. If it comes out clean, the bread is done. Oven times will vary between ovens. </li>
                    <li>Cool bread completely in the pan set on a wire rack. Feel free to drizzle with glaze (next step) while the bread is still warm. The glaze seeps down into the warm bread this way, adding extra moisture.</li>
                    <li>Make the glaze: *This doesn’t yield a lot of glaze– just a light layer. Feel free to double the glaze if you want more. Whisk the confectioners’ sugar and lemon juice together. Drizzle over bread while it’s still warm in the loaf pan or after it cools.</li>
                    <li>Slice and serve. Cover and store leftover plain or glazed bread at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Sample Websites (Recipie)</h2>
            <p><a href=https://lifemadesimplebakes.com> Life Made Simple</a> 
            <br>
            Life Made Simple, like the name suggests the interface is super simple and straightforward, opting for bold images rather than complicated graphics. The search function is also extrememly useful on this site, providing recommendations and a very interactive system to a user. All in all, a very organized yet visually enticing website for food.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.food.com/"> Food.com </a>
            <br>
            Food.com has a lot of great examples of super high impact and visual communication. When you open the cite, you are greated by large images and bold text. The search is more review based on this cite rather than focusing on subject matter or ingredients, and has quick connections to social media to make the communication of this information easier and quicker. 
            </p>
            <p><a href=https://www.bonappetit.com> Bon Appétit </a>
            <br>
            Out of all of these cites, Bon Appétit is the most intuitive of all of them, while maintaining and air of interactivity and visual interest. The scrolling mechanics on the home page of the cite are interesting and allow the cite to display a variety of different kinds of recipies, as well as pack in interesting and bright photographs of interesting recipies. The search function is also effective, allowing for easy navigation as well as

            <h2>Sample Cites (General)</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/"> The New York Times</a> 
            <br>
            As basic as it is, I really do enjoy the look/feel of The New York Times Website, mainly because it functions to look/feel like a tangible copy of the paper itself. This is especially useful for the idea of making a recipie website that mimics a tanglible hard copy recipie card, or mimicing the old with a newer more streamlined form of media.</p>
            <p><a href="https://shantellmartin.art">Shanell Martin</a>
            <br>
            I LOVE the style of this website, and the way it prioritizes the content it pushes, i.e. the artist's work. I think it's super unique that the search bar and other search tools are at the bottom of the homepage rather than the top, encouraging the user to keep looking, and take in the large image that displays the artist's work the most. </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.epicreads.com">Epic Reads</a>
            <br>
            Epic Reads is a website I LOVED when I was in high school and totally a book nerd. I was reminded of it for this project just because it's one of those websites that's a rabbit hole, with enough links and places to go from one article to another. The search function is NUTS and the exciting words and graphics make it easy to read and communicate with.Q</p>
