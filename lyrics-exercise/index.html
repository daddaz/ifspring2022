        <h2>by MGMT</h2>

       <h3> <p class = "link"> Link to song: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETEg-SB01QY"> Little Dark Age by MGMT</a> </p> </h3>
        
            <p> Breathing in the dark, lying on it's side </p>
        
            <p>The ruins of the day painted with a scar </p>

            <p>And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try </p>
       
            <p>The feelings start to rot, one wink at a time </p> 

            <p class="chorus_1"> (Chorus 1) <br>
            Oh oh, forgiving who you are, for what you stand to gain <br>
            Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away <br>
            When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded <br>     
            Horrified with each stone on the stage, my little dark age </p>

            <p>Picking through the cards knowing what's nearby </p>
       
            <p>The carvings on the face say they find it hard </p>
        
            <p>And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise </p>
        
            <p>The humor's not the same, coming from denial</p>
        
            <p class="chorus_2"> (Chorus 2)<br>
            Oh oh, I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange <br>       
            I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away <br>
            If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone <br>
            Open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age <br>
            (Dark age, dark age, dark age) <br></p>

            <p class="chorus_2"> (Chorus 2) <br>
            I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange <br>
            You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away <br>
            If I get out of bed, you'll see me standing all alone <br>
            Horrified on the stage, my little dark age </p>
        
            <p>Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come </p>
        
            <p>The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind </p>

            <p class="chorus_3">(Chorus 3) <br>
            Policemen swear to God, love's seeping from the guns <br>
            I know my friends and I would probably turn and run <br>
            If you get out of bed, come find us heading for the bridge <br>
            Bring a stone, all the rage, my little dark age</p>
        
            <p class="chorus_2"> (Chorus 2)<br>
            I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange <br>
            I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away <br> 
            If you get out of bed and find me standing all alone <br>
            Open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age <br>
            (Little dark age, little dark age) <br>
            (Little dark age, little dark age) <br>
            (Little dark age, little dark age)</p>         
            
            <p>All alone, open-eyed, burn the page, my little dark age </p>
